1 Data is the big challenge in microservices.

2 Using async communication to share data between services.

3 Async communication focuses on communicating changes using events sent to an event bus.

4 Async communication encourages each service to be 100% self-sufficient. Relatively easy to handle temporary downtime or new service creation.

5 Docker makes it easier to package up services.

6 Kubernetes is a pain to setup, but makes it really easy to deploy + scale services.

7 Skaffold handles the workflow for building, pushing, and deploying your application, and provides building blocks for creating CI/CD pipelines.
